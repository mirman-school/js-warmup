          The life of a coder
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's a reality of code: you're going to work with
          a lot of arrays. Looping over them, searching through them,
          modifying them, exporting them. It's the life of a coder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look around at how many arrays, collections of things,
          are around you right now. Bookshelves, keys on a keyboard,
          silverware, spokes on a bicycle wheel, leaves on a tree.
          The world is made of arrays. Our information especially.

          Students
        </h2>
        <p>
          So imagine you work at a school. You've been tasked with creating
          a system to manage students. It's basic <b>CRUD</b>: Create, Retrieve,
          Update, and Delete. We need a system to add new students, delete students,
          and search for specific students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, take big problems and break them down into small ones.
